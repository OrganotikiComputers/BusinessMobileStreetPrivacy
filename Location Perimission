Background Location Permission Justification

Business Mobile Street

Core Functionality Requiring Background Location

The application Business Mobile Street is a professional B2B mobile sales tool used by authorized sales representatives of client companies.

Background location access is required to support the following core business functions:

Continuous route tracking of sales representatives during working hours

Verification of customer visit locations

Recording visit timestamps and geolocation for audit purposes

Monitoring field activity for operational and commercial management

Supporting on-the-road invoicing and visit validation

Without background location access, the employer company would not be able to:

Accurately track sales routes

Confirm field visits

Maintain reliable visit history

Ensure operational transparency

Therefore, background location access is essential to the app’s primary business purpose.

How Location Data Is Collected

Tracking occurs strictly within professional use.

Location may be collected even when the app is running in the background, in order to ensure uninterrupted route monitoring.
